      <p>ABOUT: Developer Bio</p>
    </div>

      <div id="bio-blurb">
        <p> Hi, I'm Cece. I'm a full stack web developer and US history teacher living in Miami, Florida. I was born and raised in Virginia and received my bachelor's degree in political science from Virginia Commonwealth University. After graduating, I lived in Beijing and Shanghai, China for two years, where I ate a tarantula, began my teaching career, and started a choir (in that order). I am a Teach For America Miami-Dade 2013 alumni and I have taught the incredible young people of Little Haiti for the past four wonderful years.</p>
        <p>I believe deeply in the power of technology to act as a catalyst for positive social change. I use my skills as a web developer to create beautiful websites and web applications for businesses and organizations who have strong visions to improve society. My goal as a developer is to capture my client's vision and values in a way that is true to who they are. I want to highlight qualities that make them proud and set them apart from competition.</p>

        <p>I am also passionate about making computer science education more accessible to women and people of color. As an educator, I provide resources and opportunities for my students to pursue futures in a field in which they are too often underrepresented.</p>
        <p>Tripod Designs was inspired by Luna, my three-legged dog. She believes in celebrating the things that make her different. I do, too.</p>
